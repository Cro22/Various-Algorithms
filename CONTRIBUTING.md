### Guidelines

- Any programming language can be used, if its respective folder does not exist you must create it.
- All algorithms must have their own folder and README.md with an explanation of the problem.
- Test cases are allowed, but only for the person who provides an algorithm.
- Algorithms that fail the test cases will be removed unless a solution is provided.
